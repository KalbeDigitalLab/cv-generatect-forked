# GenerateCT: Text-Guided 3D Chest CT Generation

Welcome to the official repository of GenerateCT, a pioneering work in text-conditional 3D medical image generation.

This repository contains the official implementation of GenerateCT, a cutting-edge method that leverages text guidance to generate high-quality 3D medical images, with a particular focus on chest CT volumes.


Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the models, and contribute to the advancement of this exciting field!


>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our models achieve the following performances :
